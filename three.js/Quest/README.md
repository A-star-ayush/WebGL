***Between what is said and not meant,  
And what is meant and not said,  
Most of the love is lost.*** --- Khalil Gibran

Quest is a story of two lovers and a misunderstaning. No two people are narrating the story, the story is told with the help of expressive graphics and a soothing choice of background tracks.
